#### Listing statistics of queues
Lists a counter for all mail queues.

```
➜ ./postfixbuddy.py  -l
============== Mail Queue Summary ==============
Active Queue Count: 12
Bounce Queue Count: 0
Corrupt Queue Count: 0
Deferred Queue Count: 23
Hold Queue Count: 0
Incoming Queue Count: 198
```
#### Flushing mail queues
This forces Postfix to reprocess the mail queue.

```
➜ ./postfixbuddy.py -f
Flushed all queues!
```

#### Purging queues
It is possible to purge specific queues. To purge a single queue, specify the queue name after `-p`.

```
➜ ./postfixbuddy.py -p active
Do you really want to purge the active queue? (Y/N): Y
Purged all mail from the active queue!

➜ ./postfixbuddy.py -l
============== Mail Queue Summary ==============
Active Queue Count: 0
Bounce Queue Count: 0
Corrupt Queue Count: 0
Deferred Queue Count: 23
Hold Queue Count: 0
Incoming Queue Count: 198
```

#### Clean queues
This option allows you to purge all mail queues. This has been separated from the purge option to avoid accidental purging of all queues.

```
➜ ./postfixbuddy.py -c
Do you really want to purge ALL mail queues? (Y/N): Y
Do you really want to purge ALL mail queues? (Y/N): y
postsuper: Deleted: 36 messages
Purged all mail queues!

➜ ./postfixbuddy.py -l
============== Mail Queue Summary ==============
Active Queue Count: 0
Bounce Queue Count: 0
Corrupt Queue Count: 0
Deferred Queue Count: 0
Hold Queue Count: 0
Incoming Queue Count: 0
```

#### Viewing messages
It is possible to view specific mail based on their mailq IDs.

```
➜  ./postfixbuddy.py -s 6CB161202AB
*** ENVELOPE RECORDS active/6CB161202AB ***
message_size:             398             206               1               0             398

```

#### Deleting mail based on mailq ID
This option allows you to delete a specific email in the queue if you know the mailq ID.

```
➜  ./postfixbuddy.py -d 77A4D1203C2
Do you really want to delete mail 77A4D1203C2? (Y/N): Y
postsuper: 77A4D1203C2: removed
postsuper: Deleted: 1 message
Deleted mail 77A4D1203C2!
```

#### Putting mail queues on hold
It is possible to put mail queues on hold. Whilst queues are in a held state, no attempt will be made to deliver it.

Note:  while  mail is "on hold" it will not expire when its time in the queue exceeds the **maximal_queue_lifetime** or **bounce_queue_lifetime** setting. It becomes subject to expiration after it is released from "hold".

```
➜  ./postfixbuddy.py -H
All mail queues now on hold!
```

To release the queues from their held state, simply use the `-r` flag.

```
➜  ./postfixbuddy.py -r
Queues no longer in a held state!
```

#### Deleting mail by search
It is possible to specify mail to delete using `-D`. Mail in all queues will be searched for and removed. This is particularly good if a spam outbreak has occured and you know of some specific keywords or an email address that are found in all mail. If subjects contain multiple words, please wrap them in inverted commas.

```
➜  ./postfixbuddy.py -D "Some subject to find"
Total deleted: 2
```
